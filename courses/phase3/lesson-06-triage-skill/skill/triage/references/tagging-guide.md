# Tag Taxonomy

Standard tags for task classification. Apply 1-3 tags per task.

## Work Tags

| Tag | Use when |
|-----|----------|
| `bug` | Fixing broken behavior |
| `feature` | Building new functionality |
| `backend` | Server-side, API, database work |
| `frontend` | UI, client-side, CSS, React work |
| `infrastructure` | CI/CD, deployment, hosting, DNS |
| `docs` | Documentation, wiki, README updates |
| `process` | Workflow, process, or methodology changes |
| `reporting` | Reports, metrics, dashboards for stakeholders |
| `review` | Code review, doc review, design review |
| `onboarding` | New hire setup, training materials |
| `security` | Auth, permissions, vulnerability fixes |
| `performance` | Speed, optimization, scaling |

## Personal Tags

| Tag | Use when |
|-----|----------|
| `health` | Medical, dental, fitness |
| `home` | Maintenance, repairs, cleaning |
| `finance` | Taxes, bills, insurance, banking |
| `travel` | Trips, flights, hotels, logistics |
| `social` | Events, gatherings, gifts |
| `outdoors` | Hiking, camping, exercise |
| `errands` | Shopping, returns, pickups |
| `annual` | Recurring yearly tasks (taxes, renewals) |

## Combination Rules

- Use the most specific tag available (`backend` over `feature` if it's a backend feature)
- A task can mix work and tag types if relevant (e.g., `[infrastructure, annual]` for a yearly domain renewal)
- Don't over-tag — if one tag captures the essence, one tag is enough
- When in doubt, use the tag that would be most useful for filtering later

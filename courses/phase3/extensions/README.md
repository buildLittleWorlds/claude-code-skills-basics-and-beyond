# Phase 3 Extensions

Post-Phase-3 directions for expanding the task cockpit. Each guide provides enough detail for self-directed implementation using the skills and patterns you've already learned.

## Extensions

| Guide | What it adds | Complexity |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| `mcp-integration.md` | Connect cockpit to Notion, Calendar, Slack via MCP | Medium |
| `multi-model-optimization.md` | Route skills to optimal models (Haiku vs Sonnet) | Low-Medium |
| `calendar-sync.md` | Sync due dates with a real calendar | Medium-High |

## How to Use These

Each guide includes:
- **What it enables**: The new capability
- **Architecture**: How it connects to existing cockpit pieces
- **Implementation sketch**: Enough to build it, not a walkthrough
- **Phase 2 skills needed**: Which course concepts apply

These are suggestions, not requirements. Build the ones that interest you.

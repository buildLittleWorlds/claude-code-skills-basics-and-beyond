title: Update team wiki with new deployment process

We switched from manual deploys to GitHub Actions in January. The wiki still documents the old `deploy.sh` process. Pages to update:
- /engineering/deployment
- /engineering/runbooks/hotfix
- /engineering/onboarding (mentions deploy process)

Low priority but it keeps confusing new hires.
